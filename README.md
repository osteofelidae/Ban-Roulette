## Commands
`/about`: See info about the bot, including a link to this page.

`/wager [minutes] [chance]`: Risk getting banned, but get points.
* `[minutes]` is the amount of time (in minutes, obviously) that you are willing to get banned for.
* `[chance]` is a number from 1 to 5, inclusive. The higher the number, the more likely you are to get banned.
* The more `[minutes]` and the higher the `[chance]`, the more points you get.
